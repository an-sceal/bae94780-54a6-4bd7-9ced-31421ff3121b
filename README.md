He could barely concentrate. The dull pains in his hips, all his joints really, the stabbing pains in his torso and the constant cough leaving him struggling to breathe. At a rational level he had completed his plans, sent the loving, but undetailed, messages. He was just going to the horologist to get his old, old Universal Gen√®ve wristwatch fixed and he happened to leave the receipt for it on his eldest son's countertop. Yes, everything was in place. He checked his messages. Sure enough the message from the flower shop had arrived. "Your daisies are ready for collection." He glanced at the marked windows and could see the cameras with the red lights on them.

He coughed again and grimmaced. He was bored with it all.

The streetway was relatively clear, but for a large truck travelling towards him. Just a little too fast. Quick as lightning, he saw the young teen start to walk across the road, looking the direction opposite to the truck. No time to shout, he darted towards the teen to push them off the road. He saw the video screen glasses on the child, who met eyes with his. The child stopped. He slammed into the child just in time. The teen was jolted back onto the footpath, out of danger. He turned and had a quarter second to see the truck slam into him. His family and firm were distraught, but proud. A terrible tragedy, but he saved the life of a child, even with stage 4. Another success for Heroic Deaths Inc.
